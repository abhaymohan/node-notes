=====> using express.js

>> npm install express --save
-> now in js file

const express = require('express')
const app = express()                           
// express returns a function that we have assigned to app;


=====> creating and listening on a port

const express = require('express')
const app = express();

app.listen(portNumber, optionalCallback); 

=====> middleware methods

app.use()               // check only initial match of url
app.get()             // checks for exact match of url with http method type "get" in this case.
app.post()   // checks for exact match of url with http method type that is "post" in this case.


=====> utility methods on res object => app.use(req, res, next)

res.send()        // for sending the response

ex :- res.send(<p> hello </p>)                // as in node we do not have to specify the  Content-Type header though we could do that but not necessary if we do add a header by ourself than express will use it else it will add correct header by itself and in this case it will add header of "text/html" automatically.

=====> utility methods on req object => app.use(req, res, next)

=====> handling different routes using express
