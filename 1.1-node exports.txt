NODE EXPORT SYNTAX

==> EXPORT SYNTAX - 1
module.exports = router;

{here when we have to export only one thing  function or class we use this syntax and we do it at the bottom of the code.}

import 
const anyNameOfYourChoice = require('./router');

{now this varible will be treated as that exported entity which could we a function or class.}


==> EXPORT SYNTAX - 2
module.exports = { key1 : function/class};

{by this syntax we can export multiple values from one file and can access them in another file}

import
const anyVariableOfYourName = require('./router');
anyVariableOfYourName.key1 ;

{like this we can access elements of that file and this key1 will be function or class according to export.}

==> EXPORT 3
alternate syntax for second export
module.exports.keyName = function/class/variable name
module.exports.anotherKeyName = function/class/variable name
and many more key values pair

shortcut for alternate syntax
exports.keyName = function/class/variable name
exports.anotherKeyName = function/class/variable name
and many more key values pair

{ we can remove "module." and can just write exports.keyName }
==> node methods and little code
