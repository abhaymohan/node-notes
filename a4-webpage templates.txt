we have tried out 3 webpage templates pug, handlebars and ejs and choosed ejs as 
webpage template for our website.

EJS 

Theory
1.we don't have layout functionalites in ejs but we can have similar functionality 
by partials.
{layouts basically allow you to extend a template code for other code}

package install
>> npm install ejs --save


syntax
1. <% %>            // any valid js code
2. <%= %>           // for variable
3. <%- %>
